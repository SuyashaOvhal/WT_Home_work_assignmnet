<p align="center">Arthur Samuel, a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence and computer gaming, coined the term “Machine Learning”. He defined machine learning as – “Field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed”.</p>
<p align="center">In a very layman manner, Machine Learning(ML) can be explained as automating and improving the learning process of computers based on their experiences without being actually programmed i.e. without any human assistance. The process starts with feeding good quality data and then training our machines(computers) by building machine learning models using the data and different algorithms. The choice of algorithms depends on what type of data do we have and what kind of task we are trying to automate.</p>

<p align="center"  style="font-size:200%;">Classification of Machine Learning<br></p>
<p align="center">
Machine learning implementations are classified into three major categories, depending on the nature of the learning “signal” or “response” available to a learning system which are as follows:-
</p>
<p>
<b>1.Supervised learning :</b> When an algorithm learns from example data and associated target responses that can consist of numeric values or string labels, such as classes or tags, in order to later predict the correct response when posed with new examples comes under the category of Supervised learning.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.Unsupervised learning :</b> Whereas when an algorithm learns from plain examples without any associated response, leaving to the algorithm to determine the data patterns on its own. This type of algorithm tends to restructure the data into something else, such as new features that may represent a class or a new series of un-correlated values.
<p>
<p>
<b>3.Reinforcement learning :</b> When you present the algorithm with examples that lack labels, as in unsu-pervised learning. However, you can accompany an example with positive or negative feedback according to the solution the algorithm proposes comes under the category of Reinforcement learning, which is connected to applications for which the algorithm must make decisions (so the product is prescriptive, not just descriptive, as in unsupervised learning), and the decisions bear consequences. <p>
